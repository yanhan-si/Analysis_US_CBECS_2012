Initial Proposal

Yanhan Si

Question:

Among commercial buildings, how does the total energy intensity for all major fuels differ by the principal activity in that building? 


Dataset: 2012 US Commercial Building Energy Consumption

Analysis: 

          Features: 
	  	REGION - Census region
		PBA - Principal building activity
		ELUSED - Electricity used
		ELMANU - Electricity used for manufacturing
		ELCNS - Annual electricity consumption (kWh)
		MFBTU - Annual major fuel consumption (thous Btu)
		SQFT - Square footage
		FINALWT - Final full sample building weight
		FINALWT1-FINALWT197 - Final replicate weight 1-197
		
	 Function: SURVEYFREQ:
	 	   SURVEYMEAN: Calculate the total electricity consumption
		   Regression Analysis of the total electricity comsunption on region and PBA.
