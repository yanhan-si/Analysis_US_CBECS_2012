Question: Are there significant differences in the main types of energy source for manufacturing in different commercial buildings?

Dataset: 2012 US Commercial Building Energy Consumption

Analysis: 

          Features: PBA -- Principal building activity
		ELMANU -- Electricity used for manufacturing
		NGMANU -- Natural gas used for manufacturing
		FKMANU -- Fuel oil used for manufacturing
		PRMANU -- Propane used for manufacturing
		STMANU -- District steam used for manufacturing
		HWMANU -- District hot water used for manufacturing
		WOMANU -- Wood used for manufacturing
		COMANU -- Coal used for manufacturing
		SOMANU -- Solar used for manufacturing
		OTMANU -- Other source used for manufacturing
		FINALWT -- Final full sample building weight
		FINALWT1-FINALWT197 -- Final replicate weight 1-197

	 Function: SURVEYFREQ: calculate the frequency of each energy source for manufacturing by different principal building activity
		   Hypothesis test

Statistical software: SAS, R
