Initial Proposal

Yanhan Si

Question: How does the total energy intensity for all major fuels differ in different square footage category and are there siginificant differences in term of annual total electricity consumption for different region and principal building activity(PBA) types?


Dataset: 2012 US Commercial Building Energy Consumption

Analysis: 

          Features: 
	  	REGION - Census region
		PBA - Principal building activity
		ELUSED - Electricity used
		ELMANU - Electricity used for manufacturing
		ELCNS - Annual electricity consumption (kWh)
		MFBTU - Annual major fuel consumption (thous Btu)
		FINALWT - Final full sample building weight
		FINALWT1-FINALWT197 - Final replicate weight 1-197
